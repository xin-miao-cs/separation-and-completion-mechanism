Deconstruct entities: based on the attributes of the entities, ""Paul Gillmor"" can be deconstructed into the several primary properties: form: normal person, usage: serve in public office, purpose: contribute to society; ""September"" can be deconstructed into the several primary properties: form: month, usage: measure time, purpose: organize calendar.
Pair the properties between ""Paul Gillmor"" and ""September"" to reconstruct the following three scenarios:
Reconstruct the first scenario: based on the ""form: normal person"" property of ""Paul Gillmor"" and the ""usage: measure time"" property of ""September"", ""Paul Gillmor"" can live his entire life during the month of ""September"", hence we can reconstruct the scenario: routine purpose: Paul Gillmor lives his life during September.
Reconstruct the second scenario: based on the ""usage: serve in public office"" property of ""Paul Gillmor"" and the ""purpose: organize calendar"" property of ""September"", ""Paul Gillmor"" can serve in public office during the month of ""September"", hence we can reconstruct the scenario: professional purpose: Paul Gillmor serves in public office during September.
Reconstruct the third scenario: based on the ""purpose: contribute to society"" property of ""Paul Gillmor"" and the ""form: month"" property of ""September"", ""Paul Gillmor"" can make significant contributions to society during the month of ""September"", hence we can reconstruct the scenario: impactful purpose: Paul Gillmor contributes to society during September.
Identify decisive scenario: the scenario ""routine purpose: Paul Gillmor lives his life during September"" contributes the most to the relation ""date of death"".
Uncover potential relation: if we focus on another scenario ""professional purpose: Paul Gillmor serves in public office during September"", in the scenario, ""September"" is the month of ""Paul Gillmor's"" death, hence the commonsense relation is ""date of birth"".
Replace causal words: to change the original relation to the potential one ""date of birth"", the identified causal words can be replaced with ""born in"".
Output: <e1> Paul Gillmor </e1>, who was born in <e2> September </e2>
New relation: date of birth"

"Identify causal words: the context words ""cultivating"" and ""rising star"" are causally related to the relation ""origin"".
Deconstruct entities: based on the attributes of the entities, ""Waldheim"" can be deconstructed into the several primary properties: form: person, usage: mentor, purpose: support; ""Austrian"" can be deconstructed into the several primary properties: form: nationality, usage: identify, purpose: represent.
Pair the properties between ""Waldheim"" and ""Austrian"" to reconstruct the following three scenarios:
Reconstruct the first scenario: based on the ""form: person"" property of ""Waldheim"" and the ""usage: identify"" property of ""Austrian"", ""Waldheim"" can be identified as an Austrian, hence we can reconstruct the scenario: identification purpose: Waldheim is identified as an Austrian.
Reconstruct the second scenario: based on the ""usage: mentor"" property of ""Waldheim"" and the ""purpose: represent"" property of ""Austrian"", ""Waldheim"" can mentor and support an Austrian rising star, hence we can reconstruct the scenario: mentorship purpose: Waldheim mentors an Austrian rising star.
Reconstruct the third scenario: based on the ""purpose: support"" property of ""Waldheim"" and the ""form: nationality"" property of ""Austrian"", ""Waldheim"" can support the Austrian culture and values, hence we can reconstruct the scenario: cultural purpose: Waldheim supports Austrian culture.
Identify decisive scenario: the scenario ""identification purpose: Waldheim is identified as an Austrian"" contributes the most to the relation ""origin"".
Uncover potential relation: if we focus on another scenario ""mentorship purpose: Waldheim mentors an Austrian rising star"", in the scenario, ""Austrian"" is the nationality of the rising star mentored by ""Waldheim"", hence the commonsense relation is ""title"".
Replace causal words: to change the original relation to the potential one ""title"", the identified causal words can be replaced with ""mentoring as"".
Output: <e1> Waldheim </e1> was already mentoring as another rising star in the <e2> Austrian </e2>
New relation: title"

"Identify causal words: the context words ""for much of his life"" are causally related to the relation ""employee of"".
Deconstruct entities: based on the attributes of the entities, ""air force"" can be deconstructed into the several primary properties: form: organization, usage: provide military services, purpose: protect the country; ""him"" can be deconstructed into the several primary properties: form: normal person, usage: work, purpose: earn a living.
Pair the properties between ""air force"" and ""him"" to reconstruct the following three scenarios:
Reconstruct the first scenario: based on the ""form: organization"" property of ""air force"" and the ""usage: work"" property of ""him"", ""him"" can work for the ""air force"" to earn a living, hence we can reconstruct the scenario: employment purpose: him works for the air force.
Reconstruct the second scenario: based on the ""usage: provide military services"" property of ""air force"" and the ""purpose: protect the country"" property of ""him"", ""him"" can join the ""air force"" to protect the country, hence we can reconstruct the scenario: service purpose: him serves in the air force.
Reconstruct the third scenario: based on the ""purpose: earn a living"" property of ""him"" and the ""form: organization"" property of ""air force"", ""him"" can be employed by the ""air force"" to earn a living, hence we can reconstruct the scenario: employment purpose: him is an employee of the air force.
Identify decisive scenario: the scenario ""employment purpose: him works for the air force"" contributes the most to the relation ""employee of"".
Uncover potential relation: if we focus on another scenario ""service purpose: him serves in the air force"", in the scenario, ""him"" is a member of the ""air force"", hence the commonsense relation is ""title"".
Replace causal words: to change the original relation to the potential one ""title"", the identified causal words can be replaced with ""holds the position of"".
Output: <e1> air force </e1> holds the position of <e2> him </e2>
