Uncover potential relation: if we focus on another scenario ""security purpose: factory creates padlock"", in the scenario, the entity 1 ""factory"" is ""agency"", hence the relation should start with ""agency-"", the entity 2 ""padlock"" is ""instrument"", hence the relation should be supplemented as ""agency-instrument"", hence the commonsense relation is ""agency-instrument: agency uses instrument"".

Reconstruct the third scenario: based on the ""purpose: govern society"" property of ""aristocracy"" and the ""purpose: maintain order"" property of ""laws"", ""aristocracy"" should create ""laws"" to ensure social order, hence we can reconstruct the scenario: order purpose: aristocracy formulates laws.

Reconstruct the first scenario: based on the ""type: gathering"" property of ""event"" and the ""type: educational event"" property of ""workshop"", ""workshop"" should be a component of ""event"" as an educational session, hence we can reconstruct the scenario: educational purpose: workshop is a component of event.
Reconstruct the second scenario: based on the ""purpose: knowledge sharing"" property of ""event"" and the ""purpose: skill development"" property of ""workshop"", ""workshop"" should be a component of ""event"" to contribute to knowledge sharing, hence we can reconstruct the scenario: knowledge sharing purpose: workshop is a component of event.
Reconstruct the third scenario: based on the ""duration: limited time"" property of ""event"" and the ""duration: limited time"" property of ""workshop"", ""workshop"" should be a component of ""event"" as a time-limited session, hence we can reconstruct the scenario: time-limited purpose: workshop is a component of event.
